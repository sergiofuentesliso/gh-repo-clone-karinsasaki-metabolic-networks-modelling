    "To economically produce desired compounds from microbial cell factories it is often necessary to engineer their metabolic networks. Indeed, microorganisms are typically evolved for maximizing growth (or other fitness traits) in their natural habitat and not for over-producing metabolites of human interest. Retrofitting of microbial metabolism has traditionally been done through classical strain improvement that involved random mutagenesis and screening. Such approaches are laborious, unpredictable, and fail to take advantage of the rapidly increasing knowledge of how microorganisms work. Rational engineering of microbial metabolic networks is thus crucial for realizing the potential of synthetic biology. In absence of such methods, the new pathways and functionalities offered by synthetic biology risk to remain below the levels mandated by economic feasibility. Furthermore, rational design of native cellular networks will become an integral part of synthetic biology applications beyond metabolite production – new synthetic circuit must operate in harmony within the context of native networks. Metabolic networks, being relatively well charted from topological as well as mechanistic point of view, offer a good starting point to build our capability to engineer complex networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts of metabolic modeling from a synthetic biology perspective. The focus will be on stoichiometric models of metabolism as these can be applied at the scale of genome and with minimal assumptions. We will use the Python package for constrained based modelling, COBRApy."

    "# Exercise 6 - Prediction of growth phenotypes of gene deletion mutants\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use a genome-scale models (GEM) of yeast metabolism, a robust, well curated, iFF708 (Forster et al. 2003, see Appendix), covering 1379 reactions corresponding to 619 genes and 796 metabolites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting large linear models can be efficiently solved, thanks to the power of linear programming solvers such as glpk and CPLEX. Here, we will use the cglpk solver accessed via COBRApy.\n",
    "\n",
    "GEMs allow simulating growth phenotype as they include a linear reaction representing synthesis of new cells. This reaction, often termed growth reaction, combines macromolecular components (DNA, lipids, proteins etc.) and the needed energy and redox cofactors in appropriate proportions (ideally based on experimental data) towards synthesis of new biomass. The model also includes reactions for nutrient uptake and product secretion. When nutrient uptakes are constrained within, say, experimentally determined values, a linear programming problem maximizing growth reaction can predict the expected growth rate (or rather growth yield) of the cell in question. This problem (incl. its many variants) is commonly referred to as flux balance analysis (FBA, see Orth et al. 2010 in the appendix). Simulation of the effects of genetic perturbations is then possible by using the gene-protein-reaction association rules accompanying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the given yeast model, identify the growth phenotypes of all single gene deletion mutants. Perform this for the iFF708 model on minimal medium under aerobic conditions. Medium conditions are accounted for by appropriately constraining the nutrient uptake reactions). We provide below a function to change the medium conditions. In the exercises below, try to think about and answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - How many genes are essential for growth? \n",
    "    - How does this result compare with experimentally determined phenotypes (you can find these at yeastgenome.org)? \n",
    "    - How many reactions in the models are affected by the gene deletions? \n",
    "    - How many gene knock outs show decreased fitness (i.e. decreased simulated maximum specific growth rate)? \n",
    "    - Plot histograms of ratios of knock out growth rate and wt growth rate, study the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Repeat the simulations for iFF708 model using aerobic rich (ypd) medium conditions and anaerobic minimal medium conditions. Compare the results from 1. and 2. and discuss their correspondence with your expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Same as for genes, one can simulate effect of deletion of whole reaction. Under minimal medium, anaerobic conditions, identify which REACTIONS are essential for ethanol production in yeast.\n",

    "    **Ex1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Set up the simulation conditions (minimal medium, aerobic) using the setupConditions.py function provided.\n",
    "7. Make sure objective name is set to 'VGRO', i.e. name of biomass reaction in iFF708. Simulate growth under the defined conditions using the `optimize` function, save wild-type growth.  \n",
    "8. Use single_gene_deletion function for the simulations of gene deletions\n",
    "9. Use `pandas.DataFrame.from_dict` to make a table of the results of the single gene deletion simulations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Ex2.**\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Run setupConditions again to set different growth conditions for the iFF708 model (rich medium, aerobic)\n",
    "11. Simulate growth under new conditions using the `optimize` function, save wild-type growth.\n",
    "12. Use single_gene_deletion function for the simulations of gene deletions\n",
    "13. Use `pandas.DataFrame.from_dict` to make a table of the results of the single gene deletion simulations\n",
    "14. Compare the results, e.g. how many of essential genes identified in each condition? use 10e-6 as growth cuttof \n",
    "15. Compare growth rate of mutants vs wildtype, i.e. how many gene knockouts show decreased fitness (reduced growth)?\n",
    "16. Optional: for each of conditions plot histogram of mutant vs wiltype ratios, e.g. use `hist` from `matplotlib` library \n",

    "\n",
    "17. Maximize ethanol production under minimal, anaerobic condition change the objective to `ETHxtO` (for excretion of ethanol).\n",
